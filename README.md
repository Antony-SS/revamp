## Motivation
Today I looked at my personal website and hated it.\
Itâ€™s summer and I have some time, so I figure I may as well redesign from the scratch.  

Goal is to make a simple, well designed, responsivese website to showcase my work.  Using Chakra UI to help styling consistency.  The images were created using a combination of Midjourney and Photoshop.
